It was a full (48+ hours) weekend of non-stop brainstorming, designing, hacking, coding, developing and pitching to come up with the best solutions for "Green Urban Living" - the theme of the Green Hackfest.

At this hackathon it was all about applied sustainability, which is the application of science and innovation to meet human needs while indefinitely preserving the life support systems of the planet.

I was present at the front line and thoroughly enjoyed the intense brainstorming sessions that took place at the beginning of the event, the tense moments of making the rapid prototypes work, the stress prior the pitches and the excitement during the announcement of the winners - I could feel the energy flying around the hackathon with around 50 participants heavily debating, creating and pitching their green solutions that would solve the various briefs and challenges.
