About Fishackathon

Fishackathon was launched in 2014 around Secretary Kerry’s Our Ocean Conference.

Fishackathon was established to congregate brilliant minds for the purpose of developing usable solutions to address the problem of worldwide overfishing. Overfishing harms the marine environment and diminishes the already meager income of small scale fishermen. Fishackathon brings together computer programmers to find innovative ways to collect and analyze data, and find solutions for unsustainable fishing practices.

Fishackathon 2016 is hosted by the U.S. Department of State, and is the third annual event.
